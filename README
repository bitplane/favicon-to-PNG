Favicon to PNG by Gaz Davidson <gaz@bitplane.net>

Ever want to add a link to a site with the favourites icon in the page 
along with the link? I did, so I made this little toy!

Put this script in the root of some subdomain, running under a restricted
user, and the dir will fill up with icons as they are requested.

For a live example, see favicon.bitplane.net
